Hi Community! I received a lot of questions about how I solve computer vision/Machine learning problem, Generally I use OpenCV: a very capable Python library provided with already trained cascade and you can train your own.

- I created some python code file to facilitate the task for you, ready to use : https://github.com/ahbarabdellah/OpenCV 

- you find also inside 2 project example shows you how to use those code : 
  1. face detection in video on web cam :  https://github.com/ahbarabdellah/OpenCV/blob/main/execice%20-%20face%20detection%20in%20vedio%20.py 
  2. virtual paint : https://github.com/ahbarabdellah/OpenCV/tree/main/Project%201%20%E2%80%93%20Virtual%20Paint 

- and I recommend you also to read this articles:
